\section{Introduction}

\begin{itemize}
    \item explain why negative prices can occur
\end{itemize}

In today's liberalized electricity markets, electricity is traded in megawatt hours (MWh), where one MWh denotes the generation of one MW over the duration of one hour \citep{markets_for_electrical_energy}.
Thus, electricity markets have fixed time intervals serving as trading periods.
Trading within shorter time intervals better reflects the physical conditions of the energy system.
But this is not desired e.g.\ by agents who run base load generators, which constantly produce to meet the minimum demand, as they rather want a fixed price and quantity over a larger time interval in order to reduce their risks.
Hence, there are different electricity markets which trade over different time intervals.
On forward markets, electricity is traded well before its consumption in larger amounts.
Spot markets trade in the shortest time intervals, e.g.\ quarter-hourly, and are important for balancing demand and generation, which have to be equal at all times to ensure the stability of the system.
Prices on spot markets are based on the bids and offers of the agents and are set by the market operator, who manages the market.
To meet the demand, the market operator prioritizes cheaper generators.
This leads to the \enquote{merit order}, an ordering of generators by their marginal costs, i.e.\ the cost of supplying one additional marginal unit of power.
The most expensive generator needed to meet the demand sets the price.
As renewable energy sources like wind and photovoltaic (PV) have near-zero marginal costs, they enter at the bottom of the merit-order and thus depress market prices when they generate a substantial amount of electricity.
This is called the \enquote{merit-order effect}.
% TODO: find citation for merit-order - somehow not in that book??

Electricity generation can be divided into two categories: conventional and renewable. Conventional power generation refers to those power plants that require finite, fossil energy resources. These include gas, coal or oil but also nuclear power plants. On the otherside, renwable power generation uses energy sources that are continously renewed and are available unlimited. Examples are hydropower, photovoltaic, wind or biomass. Our data contains, besides the mentioned power plants, "other renewables" and "other conventionals". "Other renewables" include for example geothermal energy or landfill gas. "Other conventionals" incude trash or mineral oil. Those power plants have a small electricity generation and are merged. 

\section{Data}
We use time series data from the years 2019 to 2021 of hourly electricity generation separated by technology type and quarter-hourly intraday spot market prices, both for the bidding zone comprised of Germany and Luxembourg \citep{smard}.
Bidding zones are areas which have the same electricity price.
We transform the spot market prices to hourly intervals by taking the mean value for each hour in order to relate them to the electricity generation data.
% TODO: what does this mean?
% The data represents the net electricity generation fed into the general supply electricity network wihtout the own needs of the power plants.
The data is provided by the German Federal Network Agency who itself obtains it from the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity (ENTSO-E) and the European Power Exchange (EPEX SPOT).
Transmission system operators (TSOs) and EPEX SPOT are required by law to report and publish this data.
The Network Agency then verifies and processes the data \citep{smard_usermanual}.

Despite Pumped-Storage hydro uses hydropower to generate electricity, it is classified as a conventional source by SMARD \citep{smard_usermanual}. Therefore, we will analyse Pumped-Storage hydro seperately.

    \caption{Different electricity sources and the spot price}
    \label{fig:quarterly_mix}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:quarterly_mix} shows the relative contribution of the different electricity sources as well as the spot prices over each quarter from 2019 to 2021.
It is visible that the most important renewable sources are onshore and offshore wind as well as solar, while the largest conventional sources are brown coal and nuclear.
Moreover, market prices fall until the second quarter of 2020 to a minimum of 23.73 €/MWh, most likely due to the COVID-19 pandemic which reduced the demand and thereby depressed prices \citep{covid_electricity_systems}.
After the second quarter of 2020, the electricity prices rise significantly to a maximum of 109.88 €/MWh due to a multitude of factors, most notably an economic recovery causing demand shocks \citep{long_covid_energy_prices}.


% This price reductions can be attributed to the Covid-19 pandemic. 
% Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, there where many restrictions and lockdows for companies as well as private persons, wherefore there was a greater uncertainity in electricity demand. 
% Sarting from 2020 Q2, the price is rising independent of the propotion of renewable electricity generation and reached its maximum with 109.88 €/MWh. 
One reason are the rising gas prices. Since the most expensive generator needed to meet the demand sets the price, with rising gas prices the marginal cost of the gas power plants increases, which influences the electricity price strongly.

    \label{fig:example_day}
\end{figure}

Looking at the conditions on an individual day, Figure \ref{fig:example_day} displays the hourly electricity spot price and the proportion of the renewable energy in total energy during one day. 
It is clearly visible, that the price decreases when the renewables generate more electricity and vice versa. 
One can note that the contribution of the renewables increases between hour 8 and hour 17 during the day. 
This can be attributed to the solar system, as it generates electricity only at daytime and reaches its peek at hour 13, where the sun is at its highest point. 

\section{Methods}

In order to determine the impact of electricity generation on the spot price, we will use a linear regression estimator. 
Regression analysis is a statistical technique for investigating and modeling the relationships between variables \citep{montgomery2021introduction}. 
In our case we have two variables: the price is the dependent variable, and the electricity generation the independet variable. 
In other words, we want to estimte the spot price from the electricity generation using a linear model.
Depending on the slope of the regression line, we can then conclude on the  correlation of the two variables. 
Big slope means a high correlation, wheras a small slope means a low correlation (taking the absolute value of the slope). We will use this technique to analyze the renwable electricity generation, conventional electricity generation and explicitly on the pumped storage hydro generation. 
Our goal is to make the correlation of those variables visible and show to the merit-order effect. 

% regression line conventional: y = 0.01067163 * x - 28.191637699817782
%    "              renewable:  y = - 0.00563317 * x + 91.00702286781541
% Can we conclude that conventional increases the price twice more than
% renewable decreases it? (|Slope_con| is nearly twice as big as |Slope_ren|)

\section{Results}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Figure \ref{fig:ren_vs_con_regression} shows the opposite effects of renewable and conventional electricity generation on the prices.
    \item Data and analysis can be found on Github \citep{github_repo}.
    \item Figure \ref{fig:pumped_hydro_regression} shows that generation from pumped-storage hydro has a positive relationship with the market price.
    This is because operators of storage units do arbitrage in time in order to make a profit, i.e.\ they charge during times of low prices and discharge during times of high prices.
    Thus, prices are generally higher when they are producing.
